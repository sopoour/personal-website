  "description": "Out of curiosity I've started building a little robot car. I'm using a RPi 3B+ with an Explorer HAT. Elliot can be Remote-controlled via a remote and is unlocked via a RFID sensor. The initial set-up is based on STS Pilot by Mark Dammer with a Python based Flask application for the Backend and JS/HTML/CSS for the remote Frontend. I'm planning to add some distance and air pollution sensors as well as to use some object detection.",
