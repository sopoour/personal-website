about_title: Hi! I’m Sophia. (they/them).
about_description: I’m passionate about building accessible, creative and inclusive products that have a positive impact on society and our environment. User experience and writing clean accessible code matter to me. I sweat the details, tho keeping in mind the holistic product experience.

I’m mostly self-taught but learn what I need to build the best possible solution. I’ve worked several years as Product Manager until I’ve decided to switch career to Frontend Development. 

I'm happiest when I'm creating, learning, exploring and thinking about how to make things better. My curiosity has been my leading driver to dive into different programming languages, frontend frameworks, design systems, animations, accessibility and much more. My motto is to always follow whatever sparks that awe in you, then try it, break it and try again.
